The Micro Gas Turbine Electrical Energy dataset consists of time-series data collected from a 3-kilowatt commercial micro gas turbine. The dataset includes measurements of electrical power output corresponding to an input control signal over time. It is designed to support regression tasks for predicting electrical energy output based on input control signals. The dataset includes eight time series, representing the turbine's behavior under diverse conditions, with varying durations and input signal patterns.
